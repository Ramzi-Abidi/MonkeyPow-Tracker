    -SPA stands for single page application, is a web application or website
    that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page with new data from the web server,
    instead of the default method of a web browser loading entire new pages.
(react uses the concept of SPA)

3/ what is component ? 
    -A Component is one of the core building blocks of React
    -can be big or small

    representation of a the UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM.
    This process is called reconciliation(and this process is done in "React" by "diffing" algo).
    -=> e react ychouf e DOM taek ken sar fehe modification , w yaeml comparaison binet el RDOM w VDOM w yzid lel VDOM te3o el node ely tzeed
            Rq: (every html element is a node)
